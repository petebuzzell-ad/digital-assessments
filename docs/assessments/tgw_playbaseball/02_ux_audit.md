# UX Audit: TGW Checkout

## Cart & Checkout Assessment (tgw.com)
*   Full page reloads on every action (Add to Cart, View Cart, Guest Checkout)
*   Multi-page flow (Cart -> Billing -> Shipping -> Payment)
*   **2% drop in Cart-to-Checkout conversion** (June/July 2025) correlates with friction points below

## Critical Friction Points

### 1. Checkout Entry Friction
Three competing paths create high cognitive load:
*   New & Guest Checkout
*   Sign In & Checkout
*   PayPal Checkout

### 2. Visual Hierarchy & Color Conflict
Threshold messages use same color as checkout CTAs, reducing button prominence.

### 3. Non-Standard Flow (Billing First)
Asks for billing before shipping, deviating from standard practice and preventing early shipping cost calculation.

## Browsing Experience

### 1. Product Discovery (PLP)
*   Modern: Faceted search with autosuggest, 5x faster load (5.9s vs 31s)
*   Legacy: No autosuggest, slow load times

### 2. Product Details (PDP)
*   Modern: Clean layout, clear CTAs, stock status implied
*   Legacy: Explicit stock messaging, but cluttered and slow
