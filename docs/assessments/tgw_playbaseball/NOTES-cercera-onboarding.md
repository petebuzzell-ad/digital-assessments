# Notes: Cercera Onboarding

## Cercera Onboarding Meeting with AD team
attendees: Pete, Steve, Lucy, Tonya, Jeff, Tiffany

Assessment is due by end of month. 

Tiffany and Steve have been focused on the analytics & data.

Time to pull the rest of the functional leads in for the assessment.

High-level:
All eCommerce business across 3.5 brands - thesportsmansguide.com (out of scope), tgw.com, playbaseball.com, playsoftball.playbaseball.com.

Playsoftball.playbaseball.com is the newest brand.

Playbaseball.com launched on the new eCommerce platform earlier this year.

Business is tanking - from a sales perspective - recent weeks are down 60% YoY. Slow bleed at first has turned into 40-60% downturns YoY.

Moving from a savings brand position to a retailer position in these markets (golf, baseball, softball).

Steve Wellman leads digital marketing at Cercera.
    He said they couldn't spend enough to hit their budgets because they're already at the ROAS floor.
    example - if the budget was set at 10% of sales but they've only spent to 5% of sales.

Traffic and CVR are down significantly this year.

Tiffany's focus has been on TGW.com. Still cleaning up analytics for playbaseball.com and playsoftball.playbaseball.com as they are still stabilizing on the new playform.

PLAs started up in March and were completely abandoned by August 2025. The conversion decline between March and August was partly due to increased spend on PLAs (buying more traffic than they can convert).

*Something changed on the cart/checkout processin June/July 2025 time period that caused a 2% dip in CVR.*
    Is the site blocking people from checkout? What could be happening or what was changed?

A Clubs offering started up in June/July 2025 that is a much higher price point than standard offerings. Unclear how this offering impacts overall business yet. 

Checkout friction is high.

New platform checkout is performing worse than legacy platform.

All development hours have been spent on the new platform. Zero optimization will be done on the legacy platform or the new platform until the new platform is stable and all brands have migrated to it.

Meeting notes:
Marketing Spend Reduction and Business Performance: 
Steve, Lucy, Tiffany, and Jeff discussed the recent reduction in marketing spend, with Steve sharing insights from Steve Wellman about not being able to spend the full budget due to hitting the ROAS floor, and the team explored how this relates to declining business performance and sales trends.
	ROAS Floor Impact: Steve explained that Steve Wellman, who leads digital marketing, reported being unable to spend the full marketing budget because the business was at the ROAS floor, resulting in only half the budget being spent and raising questions about the underlying causes.
	PLAS Pullback: Steve and Tiffany noted a significant reduction in PLAS (Product Listing Ads) spend, with Tiffany detailing that PLAS spending increased in March and was turned off in August, which correlated with changes in traffic and conversion rates.
	Sales Report Reaction: Steve suggested that daily sales report reviews may have influenced the decision to cut marketing spend, as declining sales figures contributed to the perception that the business was underperforming.
Traffic and Conversion Rate Declines: 
Tiffany presented data showing significant declines in both traffic and conversion rates for the golf warehouse, with Lucy and Steve prompting discussion on the underlying causes and the impact of marketing mix and site changes.
	Traffic Decline Analysis: Tiffany reported a notable drop in site traffic, attributing part of the decline to a shift in marketing mix, specifically increased PLAS spend followed by a complete stop, which affected the quality and behavior of incoming visitors.
	Conversion Rate Drop: Tiffany highlighted a sharp decline in conversion rates, especially between March and August, linking it to changes in PLAS strategy and the tendency for users landing on PDPs (Product Detail Pages) to not add items to their carts.
	Cart Checkout Friction: Tiffany identified a sudden 2% drop in cart-to-checkout rates around early June to late July, suggesting a possible development error or technical issue that created friction and prevented users from completing purchases.
	Persistent Conversion Issues: Tiffany noted that even after PLAS spend was reduced, conversion rates did not recover, indicating that the cart friction issue continued to impact user behavior and sales.
Checkout and User Experience Challenges: 
Pete, Tiffany, and Steve discussed checkout process issues, poor user experience, and technical concerns across both the old and new platforms, with Pete raising security risks due to outdated technology and Tiffany noting additional friction from new platform changes.
	Technical Platform Risks: Pete flagged the use of AngularJS, an end-of-life JavaScript library, on the new platform, raising concerns about security vulnerabilities and the need for a risk mitigation plan.
	Checkout Process Complexity: Tiffany and Steve discussed how the replatforming introduced additional steps and friction in the checkout process, with data showing lower checkout rates and the addition of interstitial login pages.
	UX and Merchandising Issues: Pete reported poor UX, including confusing color schemes for threshold messaging and CTAs, missing product images, and generally weak merchandising, which made it difficult for users to understand products and complete purchases.
	Optimization Strategy: Steve explained that development resources were focused on replatforming, with no current optimization efforts until all platforms are complete, and recommended that the assessment focus on identifying issues and providing actionable feedback without attempting to solve all problems.
Assessment Approach and Deliverables Planning: 
Steve, Jeff, Lucy, and the team aligned on the assessment's scope, deliverables, and timeline, agreeing to use a data-driven scorecard model, collaborative note sharing, and a draft deck review scheduled for the following week.
	Scorecard Model Proposal: Jeff proposed building out a scorecard model for the assessment deliverable, which Steve supported as a scalable, data-backed approach that could be templated for future use.
	Collaborative Note Sharing: Lucy shared a link to a collaborative deck for team members to drop notes and observations, with guidance to move content into draft slides as points of view solidify.
	Timeline and Review Scheduling: Steve set a target for delivering the assessment in two weeks, with a draft to be ready by the end of the current week and a team review meeting scheduled for Monday at 2:00 PM Eastern.
	Roles and Communication: Steve and Lucy encouraged team members to reach out to them with questions, and Tiffany offered support for data-related needs, ensuring clear points of contact for collaboration.
Inventory Mix and Reporting Observations: 
Tiffany discussed a shift in product mix toward high-priced clubs and ongoing efforts to locate inventory reports, suggesting possible inventory issues with apparel and noting the team's reporting preferences.
	Product Mix Shift: Tiffany observed a significant increase in club sales around late July, speculating that inventory issues with apparel may be driving the shift, and noted that the team's reporting in Tableau is heavily focused on clubs.
Platform Access and Collaboration Tools: 
Tonya, Lucy, and Pete discussed access to the Crisera project in ClickUp, troubleshooting visibility issues and planning to resolve them by contacting Katie for assistance.
	ClickUp Access Issue: Tonya reported difficulty accessing the Crisera project in ClickUp, with Lucy and Pete suggesting it may be a permissions issue and agreeing to contact Katie to ensure all relevant team members are invited.
Follow-up tasks:
PLAS Traffic and Conversion Analysis: 
Continue cleaning up and finalizing post-replatform metrics for the baseball site to provide a clear view of traffic and conversion trends. (Tiffany)

Like we are a brand that sells these things.
Steve Janowiak 0 minutes 5 seconds
Um.
Steve Janowiak 0 minutes 8 seconds
And so that's kind of where we're at. There's, there's the replatform, there's brand change, there were inventory challenges. They certainly have cut back marketing spend in the past three months.
Steve Janowiak 0 minutes 23 seconds
Uh.
LS

Lucy Sun

Lucy Sun 0 minutes 23 seconds
Did they start cutting marketing spend because business was tanking or was that like?
Lucy Sun 0 minutes 30 seconds
Like, I don't know.
SJ

Steve Janowiak

Steve Janowiak 0 minutes 30 seconds
Yeah. So Lucy, I think I copied you on the e-mail to Steve Wellman yesterday. So those that worked at Wolverine know Steve Wellman. He leads their digital marketing. He shared with me when I talked to him a couple of weeks ago that he essentially couldn't spend enough to even hit their budget.
Steve Janowiak 0 minutes 49 seconds
Because they were at the ROAS floor. So I think we need to understand that a little bit better and why and those sorts of things. But he was saying he couldn't even spend the full budget. So if the budget was 10% of of sales, he was only spending 5.
Steve Janowiak 1 minute 5 seconds
So I want to understand that piece better. PLAS, Jeff, are one area specifically that we've seen them pull way back. We just Tiffany and I just have questions around that because maybe it's the right thing to do probability wise, but if he's just pulling up a sales report every morning.

Lucy Sun 1 minute 58 seconds

Lucy Sun 2 minutes 4 seconds
Did someone say like there was traffic and then something? I don't know.
TH
Tiffany Hsieh
2 minutes 7 seconds2:07
Tiffany Hsieh 2 minutes 7 seconds
Yeah. So traffic declined and conversion rate declined like significantly this year. I think there's two things. One, I've focused more on the golf warehouse so far. I'm still cleaning up the baseball.
Tiffany Hsieh 2 minutes 26 seconds
Like their post transition, like their post re platform has changed some of their metrics, so I'm still cleaning up those metrics so that way we have a post re platform view.
SJ
Steve Janowiak
2 minutes 36 seconds2:36
Steve Janowiak 2 minutes 36 seconds
Lucy, is this what you're talking about?
TH
Tiffany Hsieh
2 minutes 43 seconds2:43
Tiffany Hsieh 2 minutes 43 seconds
But yeah, so this is the trend that they're seeing that they're likely reacting to in that the traffic is less surprising. There's like a mix shift that we can talk through and then the conversion rate is like the scariest one.
Tiffany Hsieh 3 minutes
Um.

Steve Janowiak

TH
Tiffany Hsieh

Tiffany Hsieh 3 minutes 3 seconds
So from a traffic perspective, Jeff, for the golf warehouse, we're seeing like I'm seeing like kind of a mix into PLAS starting in March and then they essentially turn it completely off in August.

Tonya Carlson
3 minutes 19 seconds3:19
Tonya Carlson 3 minutes 19 seconds
OK.
TH
Tiffany Hsieh
3 minutes 20 seconds3:20
Tiffany Hsieh 3 minutes 20 seconds
So they like start like just looking at the traffic wise, it looks like they start spending quite a bit in PLAS and then they just like stop like so the conversion decline between March and.
JD
Jeff Davis
3 minutes 26 seconds3:26
Jeff Davis 3 minutes 26 seconds
Yep.
TH
Tiffany Hsieh
3 minutes 37 seconds3:37
Tiffany Hsieh 3 minutes 37 seconds
Like August-ish has a lot more to do with the fact that they're just spending more on PLAS and so or they're there's, yeah, they're dropping more people on PDP and those people are not adding to cart. Like that's kind of where we're seeing that and that kind of rough that trend roughly goes away when they stop.
